__Idea__  
1. The value of x has been taken using the formula 2π*f*t. f is the frequency that runs the servo fast and slow. t is the time that comes from millis() function. 2π converts the the value to radians. Then eqn sin(x)^2 is stored in y. The final angle comes from y*180. The limit of y is 1-0. For 0 angle is 0 and for 1 angle is 180. There’s no negative value. 

__Code__  
Platform: TinkerCAD  

```cpp
// Basic, no maping. Good enough.
```
